# Cryptocurrency trading

Hi, this is a project realized in course [JavaScript Moderno Gu√≠a Definitiva Construye +15 Proyectos](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-moderno-guia-definitiva-construye-10-proyectos/). The goal of this project is to give the user the real-time cryptocurrency quote in the desired currency.

## Technologies

I have used basic **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript**. Most of the styles are made in **Skeleton**.

### JavaScript

In JavaScript we use Fetch as main practice using an API of [CryptoCompare](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/). To handle the request we add a Promise, for better handling of the requests, as well as using Async/Await, for better performance and to be able to maintain it later without encouraging a callback hell.<br>
We created a simple UI with field validation, and using a function called mostrarMensaje to show the actions performed by your API requests.
